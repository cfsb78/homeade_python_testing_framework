================================
# Description

A simple Python testing framework I created.  Inspired from Kent Beck's "Test Driven Development: By Example".  

Currently, supports simple test cases and displays status for all tests. 
- Reports number of tests failed
- Reports test name that failed
- Allows for grouping of test cases into test suites
